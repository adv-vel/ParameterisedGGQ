This repository contains the code to reproduce the figures in the project "Parameterised Generalised Gaussian Quadrature Rules for Nearly Singular Ingetrals".

There are three main files.

1. interpolate_functions.jl provides helper tools to generate training data for interpolation.
2. interpolate.ipynb is the notebook in which the interpolation is done
3. power_law.jl contains code to numerically verify the partial derivatives of the elements of the parameterised rule.
